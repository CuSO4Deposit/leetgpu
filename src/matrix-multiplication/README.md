Matrix Multiplication
Easy

Write a program that multiplies two matrices of 32-bit floating point numbers on a GPU. Given matrix A
of dimensions M \* N and matrix B of dimensions N \* K, compute the product matrix C = A \* B , which will have dimensions M \* K

. All matrices are stored in row-major format.
Implementation Requirements

    Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
    The solve function signature must remain unchanged
    The final result must be stored in matrix C

Example 1:

Input:
Matrix
():
Matrix ():
Output:
Matrix ():
Example 2:

Input:
Matrix
():
Matrix ():
Output:
Matrix ():
Constraints

    1 ≤ M, N, K ≤ 8192
    Performance is measured with M = 8192, N = 6144, K = 4096
